ZS_Precision
============

Zelda Speedrun Precision. Mainly for Oot and MM(not tested).

About:
This program has been created for people who are practising Ocarina of Time/ Majora's Mask Speedrunning 
which involves the use of ESS(Extended Super Slide) positioning.

When the program is operating it will Display whether or not the user has the ESS position. 
There's also a toggle feature which will allow the use of vibration support as well. 
e.g. When ESS Right is active, the right motor in the 360 controller will activate.

The program has been released under a very early alpha stage and there are bound to be bugs all over the place, 
especailly as I'm a beginner programmer. 

Notes: 
It uses XInput for Xbox 360 controllers as that's the only controller I have at my disposal. 
Code from Katy Coe has been used and slightly modified to include vibration support. 

There are many things I would like to implement in the future, and will not simply be limited to the ESS position. 
Whenever I get the chance to update. 

I hope this is useful to some of you as it is a bit of an awkward trick to learn! 
Enjoy!!
